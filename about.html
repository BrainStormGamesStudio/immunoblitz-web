      <h1>About BrainStorm Games & ImmunoBlitz</h1>

      <p><strong>BrainStorm Games</strong> is an independent micro-studio based in Malta. Our mission is simple: build playful, compact experiences that make complex ideas easy to understand. We believe that games are powerful learning tools. When a player makes a decision, receives feedback, and tries again, they internalize concepts through hands-on practice—what educators sometimes call “stealth learning.”</p>

      <p><strong>ImmunoBlitz</strong> is our science strategy game about the human immune system. Designed primarily for learners aged 8–14 (but welcoming to curious adults), ImmunoBlitz places players in charge of defending the body against waves of microbes—viruses, bacteria, and fungi—while upgrading organs and deploying realistic interventions such as vaccines, antibiotics, antiseptics, and masks. The result is a fun, replayable loop that reinforces core ideas from biology curricula.</p>

      <div class="keypoints">
        <h3>What players learn while playing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples of microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi) and how they differ.</li>
          <li>How some diseases are transmitted and why prevention matters.</li>
          <li>Natural barriers such as skin, tears, mucus, stomach acid, and saliva.</li>
          <li>The roles of white blood cells in recognizing and fighting infections.</li>
          <li>How real-world tools—masks, antiseptics, vaccines, antibiotics—help reduce risk.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Design philosophy</h3>
      <p>We aim for “simple to pick up, rewarding to master.” The mechanics are intentionally clear—pop bubbles to damage microbes or heal organs, earn points, and choose upgrades—while the interactions between upgrades, target organs, and microbe types create meaningful strategy. Each run lasts around 20 waves, encouraging short sessions and gradual skill growth.</p>

      <h3>Who it’s for</h3>
      <p>ImmunoBlitz is useful for students revising biology topics, teachers looking for a classroom-friendly activity, and families who enjoy learning together. The game is free to play on web and Android, with limited, family-friendly ads that support continued development.</p>

      <h3>What’s next</h3>
      <p>We plan to keep improving accessibility and feedback for learners, add quality-of-life tweaks, and explore optional modes such as ranked leaderboards. If you’d like to suggest features or report a bug, we’d love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:info@brainstorm-games.com">info@brainstorm-games.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Thank you for supporting independent educational games and helping us make science more approachable, one level at a time.</p>
